##Notes for Team
1. navbar fixed on application.html is not allowing container to change width properly
2. Icons not working:
"<i class="material-icons right">send</i>"
3. require minimum chars in message before submit
4. react component NewchatMessage.js not functional  - replace ajax post in application.js
